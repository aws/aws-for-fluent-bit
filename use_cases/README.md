# AWS for Fluent Bit Use Case Guide

The goal of this guide is a central location for all tutorials on solving use cases for AWS customers with Fluent Bit.

## Troubleshooting errors and issues

## ECS FireLens Examples

All FireLens (side-car) examples for ECS are housed in their own repo: [aws-samples/amazon-ecs-firelens-examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecs-firelens-examples)

We have guides on everything from JSON parsing to sending Fluent Bit's internal metrics to CloudWatch Metrics, and much much more. 

## ECS Daemon Service Examples

Coming Soon!
