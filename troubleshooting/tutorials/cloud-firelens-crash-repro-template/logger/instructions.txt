# Usage: Set the following env vars:
#
# STDOUT_LOGGER_RATE => logs per second to send to stdout
# FILE1_LOGGER_RATE => logs per second to send to /tail/file1.log$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H")
# TCP_LOGGER_RATE => logs per second to send to TCP_LOGGER_PORT
# TCP_LOGGER_PORT => TCP port of TCP input in Fluent Bit, if used
#
# If you do not need one of these loggers, simply remove its entry from the loop
# in the logger.sh
#
# you can easily configure additional loggers as needed
# just add another entry in the while loop
# and import the new file in the Dockerfile
#
# Build this container with `docker build`, push to ECR, and use in task def for logger
